## Introduction

My proposed Applocation named **Fantasy Points** calculates the fantasy points of the **Basketball** game of the required players with respective to their game stats. 
It can also sort by the players name and their team wise (alphabetical), and their fantasy points and action of the points  scored by them (eg. Steals, blocks ,Rebounds,etc.)

## Research

In previous method, we cannot sort out any specific players with their points and their action of points. 
But, in this method we can sort our only required players by their team name, fantasy points and action of points.

## Cost and Features and Timeline

Since 2017, there are number of online betting games with risking our money on the players. If we want to create a team by shortlisting the important players with their skills and their performance on previous games.

## Defining Our System
So, Despite of analysing their fantasy points on the past games, we need to analyse their strengths (**Action of Points**) on their past games. With our application, we can easily sort the players by their game strengths.


## SWOT ANALYSIS:

**Strength**   : Very Useful to the every beginners on the Fantasy team prediction apps.

**Weakness**   : Not much effective in a start of a new leagues or tournaments.

**Opportunity**: Much friendly to use in effective manner. Player's Current form can help in this type of prediction.

**Threat**     : Due to risk on the money, it's just a predictio on players. So no one can say the player's performance before the match.


## 4W's and 1'H:

**What:** The current fantasy team apps does not have the option of sorting the players with their action of points. 

**Who:** So our application will attend that level which is more informative to the candidates who are playing fantasy  predictive apps.

**What:** This will very helpful to predict a 8 players based on their role with respective to their strengths.

**Where:** If any current Fantasy Prediction Apps want to upgrade, this will more effective and the candidates will eagerly participate in contests without negative thoughts.

**How:** Implement the Sorting mechanism on the past games with the player statistics.
