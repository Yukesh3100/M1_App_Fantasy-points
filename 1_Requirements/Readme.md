## Introduction

My proposed Applocation named **Fantasy Points** calculates the fantasy points of the **Basketball** game of the required players with respective to their game stats. 
It can also sort by the players name and their team wise (alphabetical), and their fantasy points and action of the points  scored by them (eg. Steals, blocks ,Rebounds,etc.)

## Research

In previous method, we cannot sort out any specific players with their points and their action of points. But, in this method we can sort our only required players by their team name, fantasy points and action of points.
